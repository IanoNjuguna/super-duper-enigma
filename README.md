This is IanoNjuguna's application.

## Dear Imran

This is an expression of [my interest](https://github.com/IanoNjuguna) in the Social Media and Digital Marketing Manager position for the [savannahSilicaTechies Twitter account](https://twitter.com/savannahtechies).

### My Experience

I have used Social Media since 2013 and I've been an active user on Twitter since 2017. That alone gives me the confidence to contribute to the success of our organisation's brand on Twitter. I am always up to date on the latest features and changes to the platform.

I have a deep understanding of the unique opportunities and challenges that come with managing a Twitter account, and I am well-versed in best practices for creating engaging content, growing an audience, and measuring the success of social media campaigns.

To do this, I will:

#### Develop a content strategy:
   
   I will create a plan for the types of content that will be shared on Twitter, including text, images, videos, and infographics. The purpose for this is to increase our engagement by increasing the quantity of quality tweets.

#### Engage with your audience:
    
    I will respond to tweets promptly, start conversations, and build relationships with followers. This will help us create an active community of Twitter users of varying experience levels in their developer journeys.

#### Use hashtags:
    
    I will use relevant hashtags to increase the visibility of our tweets and join conversations about relevant topics.

#### Monitor and measure:
    
    To do this, I will use Twitter analytics to track our progress and make data-driven decisions about our content and engagement strategies. This will help us identify and double down on conversations that are not only helpful to our audience, but also set us apart from the various developer communities that are in the developer space.

#### Stay current: 
    
    As the man in charge of running the organisation's brand on Twitter, I will keep up with the latest Twitter features and best practices, and implement them into our strategy.

#### Collaboration:

    I will collaborate with other organizations, influencers and experts in our industry to increase our reach and credibility.

#### Authenticity:

    I will show the human side of our brand by sharing behind-the-scenes content and highlighting our stories.

#### Consistency:

    I will keep our branding consistent across all social media platforms, including the use of logos, colors, and messaging.


The opportunity to bring my skills and experience to the savannahSilica team fills me with excitement and it'll help enhance the brand's presence on Twitter. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to our success.
